            Chapter 1: Kunikida collects the President
        </h2>
        <p>
            Dazai looked at the clock, then the door, and then at Kunikida, he’s been doing this for about 15 minutes now. 
            He told the President about the pet store down the road bringing in kittens from a shelter, to hopefully get people to adopt them, 
            and they let people in and pet them… that was nearly 3 hours ago. He sighed heavily as he stood up, and lazily trotted over to Kunikida’s desk.
            “Kunnniiiikiiiidddaaaa~” he leaned on his coworkers desk as he looked down at the reports, pushing them off the desk itself. 
            “We haaaavvere a proooblem… and I may have caused it.. but it doesn’t involllvvee meee~” he smirked a bit.
            <br>
            Kunikida was so focused on the paperwork he'd been working on he didn't notice Dazai until he had rudely leaned onto the desk messing everything up. 
            He sighed deeply, slowly counting down until he reached zero. "What is the matter exactly?" he muttered, his eyes widened slightly as his coworker continued to talk. 
            "Oh no, Dazai... What did you do this time?" he asked slowly, letting out another sigh. 
            With Dazai, he didn't really know what to expect. This might either be VERY dangerous or extremely silly, 
            which was certainly even more terrifying if he thought about it.
            <br>
            Dazai looked at his ‘dear friend’ and his smile dropped. “Well Kunikida-kun… I’m hurt you’d say that about me… but anyway.. 
            I accidentally mentioned the fact that the pet shop down the road is having a few animals from.. the shelter and all.. and a certain cat person overheard” 
            he explained carefully, hoping the other would understand without him having to be specific.
            “And this person has been gone for 3 hours… aaannnndddd what if someone attacks them.. our agency is ruiuiinnneeddd” he leaned dramatically. 
            <br>
            He cursed under his breath, "Cats and... Oh I get what you mean now..." Dazai didn't need to say more because Kunikida already knew what was happening. 
            He stood up, already grabbing his coat and trying to place all the remaining paperwork in a certain spot so that he would finish it later.
            "Don't worry I will go and investigate what's happening." he grabbed a tissue and wiped the sweat from his forehead, "3 hours, oh god, that's a lot." 
            He looked so worried and it was understandable since this was about Fukuzawa. "I will be back soon." Kunikida mumbled, 
            giving Dazai a look that said 'Please don't do anything stupid.', he had given that look his students so many times it was like second nature to him by now. 
            He moved towards the door and opened it, "If I'm not back in 2 hours, there is something really wrong going on."
            <br>
            Dazai hopped up on Kunikida's chair and squatted down. "I'm in charge now.." he grinned to himself before looking over at Kunikida, 
            he recognised that look on the other’s face. "PFFTTT Like i'd ever do anything stupid!" he rolled his eyes, and put a hand to his heart, pretending to be hurt. 
            "2 hours eh? I'll give you 4... you severly underestimate the power of cats.." he smirked. He grabbed onto Kunikida's desk and spun around. 
            "HAAAVVEE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN" he sang out as he spun.
            <br>
            He let out another sigh, like he wanted Dazai to hear him this time. "Right..." he mumbled, slamming the door behind him.
            It was not like he was angry for doing this but it would be preferable if it hadn't happened in the first place,
            especially since the port mafia never joked with them. Who knew what would happen to Fukuzawa if they left him alone like that. 
            Kunikida knew very well that he was strong and very much capable of defending not only himself, but many other people, 
            but he was not ready to risk anything or test any different scenarios. 
            His exited the building, having his precious notebook clutched to his chest. Now... 
            Where was that pet shop again? He thought for a bit, until he finally remembered the location and then, he immediately started running.
